# SQL & Data Analytics Practice Scripts

Welcome to my **SQL & Data Analytics Practice Scripts** repository!  

This repository contains my personal collection of SQL scripts designed for practice and learning. It covers a wide range of SQL topics and techniques, from basic queries to advanced data analytics concepts.

---

## **Topics Covered**

- **SELECT Queries** – Basic retrieval of data  
- **Data Definition (DDL)** – Creating, altering, and dropping tables  
- **Data Manipulation (DML)** – Insert, update, delete operations  
- **Filtering & Joins** – WHERE, LIKE, INNER/OUTER JOINs  
- **Aggregate Functions** – SUM, AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY  
- **Window Functions** – Ranking, partitioning, and analytics functions  
- **Case Statements & Conditional Logic**  
- **Date, Time, and String F**
- 
Open the scripts in your preferred SQL editor
(e.g., MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Explore, run, and practice the queries to strengthen your SQL skills.

FUTURE UPDATES
I will continue to upload additional SQL scripts, coding projects, and data analytics projects here.
Stay tuned for new scripts and exercises as I build my portfolio.
